# cs-3390-group-numbers

This site displays scans of the numbered slips used to assign students to groups in CS 3390 at The University of Utah in the Fall of 2022. They collected a lot of doodles by the end of the semester that we thought would be fun to look at.

Enjoy!

If you want to download all of the scans, just download the repo. The images are in `public/scans/`
