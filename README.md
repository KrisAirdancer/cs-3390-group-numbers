# cs-3390-group-numbers

This site displays scans of the numbered slips used to assign students to groups in CS 3390 at The University of Utah in the Fall of 2022. They collected a lot of doodles by the end of the semester that we thought would be fun to look at.

The site is live [here](https://krisairdancer.github.io/cs-3390-group-numbers/) Enjoy!

If you want to download all of the scans, just download the repo. The images are in `public/scans/`
